            <p>Heyyo,</p>
            <p>I had the same issue when trying to complete Level-7 as well, and I didn't want to make it such that the file had to pre-exist/be created by the user before using the program.</p>
            <p>Here's some articles on stackoverflow that I referred to for this problem: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9620683/java-fileoutputstream-create-file-if-not-exists">Create File if not exists</a>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2833853/create-whole-path-automatically-when-writing-to-a-new-file">Create whole path automatically</a>.</p>
            <p>In short, use .getParentFile().mkdirs() on your file object to create the necessary directory, and use .createNewFile() to create the file itself. Hope that helps!

            <ol start="3">
              <li>Under system variables, look for a JAVA_HOME and double click it and modify the variable value to the path of your JDK 11 (without the /bin folder).</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If it doesn't exist, create one (but I presume it should, since gradle is already working, else it would throw an error message.)</p>
            <p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4518827/63953040-25952980-cab3-11e9-8853-7607680cffce.jpg" target="_self"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4518827/63953040-25952980-cab3-11e9-8853-7607680cffce.jpg" alt class="img-fluid"></a></p>
            <p>The steps would differ if you use Mac OS (and I am not too sure, since it worked out of box for me), but you can try referring to <a href="https://medium.com/zendesk-engineering/setting-java-home-on-mac-os-acd44e3a6027">this Medium article</a> for that.</p>

            <p>I infer that you're on Mac OS from the directory structure your indicated. It seems that Prof and Jeffry didn't encounter the issue as Mac OS/Unix systems in general are much more anal than Windows when it comes to file naming conventions (being case-sensitive by default, amongst other things).</p>
            <p>edit: I just did some quick research and it turns out that Windows automatically removes whitespaces from directories while macOS/Unix does not. So do take note when addressing your file names!</p>
            <p>Hope that helps and don't forget to close the issue if it's been resolved!

            <p>That looks like a print statement, so I dug through your code to find it.</p>
            <p>Your program uses the file /data/duke.txt relative to the directory that the jar file is launched.</p>
            <p>In your case, you likely launched the jar file from the <code>build</code> folder and since it didn't already have a data/duke.txt, that triggered the print statement in Line 46 of your Duke.java (according to <a href="https://github.com/ChangUo79/duke/blob/master/src/main/java/Duke.java">your latest commit here</a>), hence printing 'File not found.'</p>

            <p>Hmm, as @Nanosync suggested, you probably need to refresh your gradle configuration within IntelliJ. It might have been the case that you did not click the prompt to import gradle configuration changes within IntelliJ when you modified your build.gradle.</p>
            <p>Try refreshing again? I've attached a gif of how to do so just in case:</p>
            <p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4518827/64838311-21294e80-d625-11e9-8f35-203fa493a389.gif" target="_self"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4518827/64838311-21294e80-d625-11e9-8f35-203fa493a389.gif" alt class="img-fluid"></a></p>
            <p>Otherwise, can you also try re-importing your project?</p>

            <p>I think this is best illustrated with an example.</p>
            <p>Let's say we have a while loop that can loop <strong>up to</strong> 100 times.</p>
            <p>For us to achieve a 100% statement coverage - we just need to test one iteration of the while loop. That executes all the statements within the while loop's code block - thereby achieving full statement coverage.</p>
            <p>To achieve full path coverage, we have to test for every possible path - that means that we test the while loop for 1, 2, 3 ... 99, 100 iterations each time, to ensure that it produces the correct result each time. That's a far more comprehensive test, and only when all paths have been exhausted through testing can it be considered full path coverage. And definitely a lot more work to be done, testing-wise.</p>
            <p>This applies to any form of conditionals or loops within a program - you'd have to test all possible number of iterations and/or all possible branches to ensure 100% path coverage, as compared to once for statement coverage.</p>
            <p>Hope that illustrates it for you!

            <p>Remove the following lines from your build.gradle</p>
            <p><code>id 'org.openjfx.javafxplugin' version '0.0.7' //javafx</code> (line 6)</p>
            <p>and</p>
            <p>`javafx {</p>
            <pre><code>version = &quot;11.0.2&quot;

modules = [ 'javafx.controls', 'javafx.fxml' ]
</code></pre>
            <p>}` (line 23-27)</p>
            <p>they are no longer required as the JavaFX dependencies will be specified by lines 43 - 60 instead (you can also optionally choose to remove line 55 - 60 as they are unnecessary).</p>
            <p>Your jar file generated by shadowJar should then be able to run on any system.</p>
            <p>However, I noticed another bug during testing - your program won't launch if the file data/duke.txt is not present. You might want to look into ways to create the file automatically instead of throwing an exception and closing - see <a href="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/forum/issues/27">https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/forum/issues/27</a></p>

              <p>In the second case, <code>File imageFile = new File(IMAGE_DIRECTORY + value);</code> assumes that the given path starts from the project root directory (i.e. starting from <code>/main/...</code>). However, your image is actually stored in the resource folder, which is not the root level directory. The first case works because <code>getResourceAsStream</code> reads a file from <code>src/main/resources</code>.</p>

            <p>Hello again! A new issue has arise after the previous issue was solved. Currently many of my test cases are failing due to this line <code>photo = new Image(&quot;file://&quot; + imageFile.toURI().getPath());</code> for some reason. From what I know, there is some initialization problem and there is trouble getting the images.</p>
            <p>Some screenshots of the exceptions and errors:</p>

              <p>I suspect the bulk of these errors goes down to the failure to initialize <code>Photo</code>. More specifically, this RuntimeException: <code>java.lang.RuntimeException: Internal graphics not initialized yet</code>.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>In <code>Photo.java</code>, you are instantiating <code>photo</code> with type <code>Image</code>, which is a JavaFX component that depends on the JavaFX toolkit. This adds dependency to the JavaFX library right from the lower level classes. Thus, in unit testing, the JavaFX toolkit is not set up since only classes that extend <code>Application</code> (or subclasses of these classes) will start up the toolkit but here, only <code>MainApp.java</code> extends <code>Application</code>. Hence, <code>Image photo</code> cannot be instantiated.</p>

              <p>Perhaps you can let the <code>Photo</code> class have an instance variable that contains the file path of the image file, then instantiate the <code>Image</code> within the <code>Ui</code> component using this file path!</p>

            <p>It's not explicitly shown but avoidance of custom written parser and serialization should reduce the possibilities of bugs, I think? Since standard libraries are battle-tested.</p>
            <p>IMO, I'm currently thinking that using standard libraries instead of custom written code base improves:</p>

            <p>Nothing wrong with the above output, but the stack trace shows there might be a problem with your storage parsing.</p>
            <p>I'm just guessing it's untested behavior from saving an event task and loading it (somehow tries to load it as a deadline task). You can try clearing your savefile and see if your jar file opens without issue?

            <p>I suspect that the URI does not actually translate into URL. Otherwise, I think it might be due to the lack of escape slashes in the string.

            <p>Maybe it would be good to remove the duplicated module by going to project structure &gt;&gt; module, and remove the 'main' module which is duplicated, cuz the issue of duplicated modules has just caused problems for my code when trying to use some javafx methods.

            <p>I think the main course behind the issue &quot;could not find or load main class Duke&quot; is because java cannot find the <code>.class</code> file of Duke to load it. When Duke was in the <code>package duke</code>, was the <code>mainClassName</code> in your gradle is <code>duke.Duke</code>?

            <p>Uhm what did you put for the <code>mainClassName</code> in your <code>build.gradle</code> file though? Is it <code>duke.Launcher</code>? If yes, did you put your <code>Launcher</code> class inside a package called <code>duke</code>?

            <p>I faced similar issues as well and what I did is I first determine which test fails first and also why it fails (from the console which shows the assertions error). The most common problem I faced is the actual <code>Command</code> or <code>CommandResult</code> generated is <strong>not equal</strong> to the expected one. It's usually due to differences in some values, for example, the content of the <code>remark</code> in the <code>CommandResult</code>, which is usually because of putting different values for the field in where the expected result is generated and where the actual command is generated. (sometimes the result is generated from the data file)</p>
            <p>I put a breakpoint at the relevant line before the assertion in the test method (which fails) and run the debugger and track the value of <code>Command</code> and/or <code>CommandResult</code> step by step, stepping into the relevant methods as necessary. I focus especially on the value(inner content) of <code>Command</code> or <code>CommandResult</code>, e.g. <code>name</code> and <code>address</code>. When I found out the point <strong>where the difference in value occurred</strong>, I will do some backtrack to find <strong>where</strong> the actual <code>Command</code> and/or <code>CommandResult</code> is generated to see what causes the differences in value and then fix it accordingly.</p>
            <p>Hope this helps!

            <p>I think you can click on <code>releases</code> in the repo page of your team, then click on <code>new release</code>. You can then add a tag there which will tag the latest commit of your team repo.</p>

            <p>The strange thing is, even after complaining about the test failures in the lecture, I managed to fix them with the IDE debugger, around nine hours before this announcement (see #87 and my branch's commits linked from there, e.g. <a href="https://github.com/Parcly-Taxel/main/commit/8475c2f822eecf570a475af7250f18d313acd292">this</a>).

              <p>Technically, that's not a problem. Gradle just recognized that there were no new changes and skipped testing. As a result, no results were reported to IntelliJ. By running <code>:cleanTest</code>, you basically forced Gradle to compile and run the tests again.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Yea I just realised taking a closer look that the folder structure doesn't seem to be an issue. However, I still get the &quot;Test events were not recieved&quot; original error even after running gradlew cleanTest and can't see the output of the tests passing as shown in the examples I've seen. Am I correct in assuming my tests work for now though and is there anything I need to change to get the same output as shown below? Or am I correct in assuming everything is fine and the result shown in the example below is because Gradle was not used?</p>

            <p>Ok thanks again for your help I think I more or less figured it out! One last question, when I swapped to IntelliJ IDEA and then selected &quot;Add JUnit 5.* to classpath&quot; under Test as per the instructions under Week 3, my test files now get errors highlighted and when I try to run all tests I get the error:</p>
            <p>&quot;No tests were found&quot; and the popup &quot;Tests were not found in module &quot;test&quot;. Use module &quot;main&quot; instead&quot; as shown in the screenshot below. When I switched back to Gradle the tests still ran fine. Is there any way to configure it such that I can switch between both easily? I suspect the adding JUnit to classpath was what caused the error as simply swapping to using IntelliJ in the settings did not cause the issue at first. Else it seems I'll stick to using Gradle though I want to understand what's happening here.</p>
            <p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38809578/64131816-c3fbf480-cdfd-11e9-9687-cded4a55d510.PNG" target="_self"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38809578/64131816-c3fbf480-cdfd-11e9-9687-cded4a55d510.PNG" alt class="img-fluid"></a></p>
            <p>Edit: Even after switching back to Gradle in the settings, right-clicking and running all tests results in the errors shown above. Only when I run gradlew test from the command line does the test complete successfully.</p>

            <p>Looks like IDEA would only optimize imports on changed files, and that was the reason why it didn't apply the new rules to all files. I right clicked on src folder and optimized every file inside and now it passed tests. Thanks!

            <p>I looked through the release notes for Checkstyle and found that version 8.2 removed the <code>FileContentsHolder</code> module, which would explain the failure to instantiate the module and thereby, the exception thrown since Gradle uses version 8.1.</p>

            <p>In the second case, <code>File imageFile = new File(IMAGE_DIRECTORY + value);</code> assumes that the given path starts from the project root directory (i.e. starting from <code>main/...</code>). However, your image is actually stored in the resource folder, which is not the root level directory. The first case works because <code>getResourceAsStream</code> reads a file from <code>src/main/resources</code>.</p>
            <p>You might want to consider letting your <code>IMAGE_DIRECTORY</code> = <code>src/main/resources/images/</code> for the time being, while still running in the IDE. This will allow <code>new File(IMAGE_DIRECTORY + value)</code> to get the file from the root directory.

              <p>But what if the jar file isn't inside the project directory and moved to another directory with an <code>images</code> folder? For example, i moved the jar file to <code>Documents</code> and there is an <code>images</code> folder. How then would I retrieve the images?</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Ah I see! I suspect your solution would work if the jar file is actually the case as you mentioned. However, if you are still running from your IDE, this method would break down since <code>new File(...)</code> will attempt to read from the root project directory.</p>
            <p>Have you tried building the jar file and manually testing to see if it works?

            <blockquote>
              <p>i built the jar file with an <code>images</code> folder and the relevant images in the <code>Documents</code> directory but it doesn't seem to work.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>I examined your code further and realised that your <code>IMAGE_DIRECTORY</code> = <code>/images/</code> instead of <code>images/</code>.</p>
            <p>Placing a leading slash makes the path an absolute file path instead of a relative path, thus this references to <code>C:/images/</code> (assuming you're using Windows), instead of <code>C:/path/to/jar/folder/images/</code>.</p>
            <p>In addition, <code>new Image(path)</code> requires <code>path</code> to start with <code>file://</code> in order to load the image through <code>ImageView</code>.</p>
            <p>Hence, to sum up, you might want to try the following changes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><code>IMAGE_DIRECTORY = images/</code></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><code>new Image(&quot;file://&quot; + imageFile.toURI().getPath())</code></p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>I've tried these changes on my end and it works through the jar file. Hope it works for you as well! 😃

              <p>Thank you so much! Definitely working now. Would this work with the IDE or only for jar files?</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Glad to hear it works!</p>
            <p>It should be able to work in the IDE as well, provided you have an <code>images</code> folder in your root project directory i.e. <code>main/images/</code>. You can specify this folder in <code>.gitignore</code> so that it won't be pushed into the remote repo.</p>
            <p>Additionally, note that your application does not automatically create an <code>images</code> folder in the root directory, so you might want to consider automatically creating this folder when your user launches the app to aid your user.

            <p>Hi!</p>
            <p>I suspect the bulk of these errors goes down to the failure to initialize <code>Photo</code>. More specifically, this RuntimeException: <code>java.lang.RuntimeException: Internal graphics not initialized yet</code>.</p>
            <p>In <code>Photo.java</code>, you are initializing <code>photo</code> with type <code>Image</code>, which is a JavaFX component that depends on the JavaFX toolkit. This adds dependency for the JavaFX library right from the lower level classes. Thus, in unit testing, the JavaFX toolkit is not set up since only classes that extend <code>Application</code> (or subclasses of these classes) will start up the toolkit but here, only <code>MainApp.java</code> extends <code>Application</code>. Hence, <code>Image photo</code> cannot be initialized.</p>
            <p>Perhaps you can let the <code>Photo</code> class have an instance variable that contains the file path of the image file, then instantiate the <code>Image</code> within the <code>Ui</code> component using this file path!

            <p>Regarding exceptions</p>
            <p>I’m of the view that strictly following 1a or 1b is not an optimal solution.</p>
            <p>Instead, I think that wherever possible, we should use Java’s exceptions instead.</p>
            <p>For instance, InvalidTaskId should use IndexOutOfBoundsException.</p>
            <p>In the rare scenario where we have a duke-specific exception that does not fit any of Java’s exceptions, we should extend it from DukeException.</p>
            <p>However, if the exception can be used outside of duke, and is not covered by any of Java’s exceptions, we should extend it from Exception. An example of this would be DuplicateDataException.</p>
            <p>Please correct me if I’m wrong! Would love to hear other opinions about this.

            <p>Thanks for taking the time to explain <code>git revert</code> in detail Iskandar!</p>
            <p>I'd like to add on a cautionary note about tags since we are on the note of reverting/reseting commits.</p>
            <p>If you have pushed your tags to your remote repo with <code>git push --tags</code> reverting or deleting your commits will not remove your tags on the remote repo.</p>
            <p>So how do we resolve this?</p>
            <p>You may be tempted to use <code>git tag --delete</code> but this only deletes them locally.</p>
            <p>Instead, you have to use <code>git push origin :tagname</code></p>
            <p>Alternatively, you may also update your git tags locally, then <code>git push --tags -f</code></p>
            <p>Please refer to this stackoverflow post for a more in depth discussion about removing tags on remote repos. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5480258/how-to-delete-a-remote-tag">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5480258/how-to-delete-a-remote-tag</a></p>

            <p>Okay prof, thanks for your suggestion. Yeah cause i do think there is a benefit in making such a feature, as our application will be used by hospital and people need to be careful and typically the user will want to double check if what they keyed in is correct. Will try to do both modes. Thanks prof!

            <p><strong>1. JNI error occurs during compilcation.</strong></p>
            <p>My solution: This error may happen if you have changed your JDK version before. delete old JDK version and reopen duke project worked for me.</p>
            <p><strong>2. If you have created multiple files for different classes.</strong> Modified my .bat as follows</p>
            <p><code>javac -cp ..\src -Xlint:none -d ..\bin ..\src\main\java\Task.java ..\src\main\java\Todo.java ..\src\main\java\Event.java ..\src\main\java\Deadline.java ..\src\main\java\DukeException.java ..\src\main\java\Duke.java</code></p>

              <p>Uhm what did you put for the <code>mainClassName</code> in your <code>build.gradle</code> file though? Is it <code>duke.Launcher</code>? If yes, did you put your <code>Launcher</code> class inside a package called <code>duke</code>?</p>

            <p>Yes. I put Launcher inside package duke and change mainclass in build.gradle. And gradle run command is successful without any problem. This error occurs only when I run my jar file.

            <p>If I could opine in on this issue, I'd say both approaches have their pros and cons, which you've highlighted in the above comments. While Object-Level validations align with the essence of OOP, it could be a bit tedious to deal with similar cases in multiple objects. This will ultimately lead to a lot of redundant and repeated code.</p>
            <p>A partial solution could be to handle common cases like white-space/empty inputs at the input-class level, leaving the object constructors to deal with more specific invalid inputs relevant to their associated objects.</p>
            <p>To add on, we could abstract the input class at a higher level to a machine that accepts input. The machine has no idea what the valid input for other machines (objects) are. However, there are certain inputs that are invalid inputs for ALL objects. These can be handled at the input class level.

            <p>@damithc I think I resolved the problem, by removing a file with name &quot; .\src\test\java\dream\fcard\util\data\Test.java &quot; from my repo. Then, RepoSense produced a valid report after I removed this file with slashes in the name.</p>
            <p><a href="https://github.com/huiminlim/main/commit/c3215ba03a6d3d2c126d98f9b6c0b2376a3ffebc">https://github.com/huiminlim/main/commit/c3215ba03a6d3d2c126d98f9b6c0b2376a3ffebc</a></p>
            <p>I think that RepoSense does not accept files with slash in names.</p>
            <p>Thank you and RepoSense dev team for the help anyway!

            <p>Hi Prof Damith, looks like this is the output i obtained on Windows 10, and no error is shown when I run both the gradle and just the task alone. Not sure if I did the correct way as you advised.</p>

            <p>Let's look at the Todo object for example. We could do validation in two ways:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>Validate input before passing it to the constructor (perhaps by having a method in <code>Duke.java</code> raise exception if <code>description</code> is blank).</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Validate user input in Todo constructor (perhaps by raising exception if <code>this.description</code> is <code>null</code>)</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>I'm thinking of whether option 2 would be more appropriate, since it results in the Todo class being responsible for not allowing &quot;invalid&quot; Todo objects to exist, as opposed to having the main class handle it or creating a new class specifically to validate inputs.

            <p>Thanks for the response Sudharshan, really appreciate your contribution to the discussion.</p>
            <p>About the input class, that makes a lot of sense. It just acts as a filter to remove inputs that are obviously gibberish or incomplete, while the respective objects deal with whether the input is &quot;correct&quot; (e.g. startTime &lt; endTime).

            <p>The difference between the two commands is that <code>git push --follow-tags</code> only pushes tags that are both annotated (similar idea to commit message) and reachable (in the current commit history).</p>
            <p>Let's start with reachability. Imo it doesn't make sense to have a tag pointing to an unreachable commit (unless you, for some reason, want to keep a copy of it) and more importantly may confuse people.</p>
            <p>As for annotations, they are there to give meaning to the tag you have created by giving a short summary of what the tag is for (e.g. what does &quot;Level-6&quot; of your project mean? What major change does it introduce?).</p>
            <p>Hope this helped to clarify some of your doubts. I've only recently read up on tags so please correct me if I'm wrong. The Stack Overflow post links to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11514075/what-is-the-difference-between-an-annotated-and-unannotated-tag">another</a> post that explains annotated tags and their use cases quite well, I recommend giving it a read.

            <p>Thanks Shawn, I believe your solution should quickly solve OP's issue. Lets take a moment to appreciate the difference between a revert and reset. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8358035/whats-the-difference-between-git-revert-checkout-and-reset">This</a> StackOverflow post should explain things pretty clearly.</p>
            <p>TL:DR, a revert introduces another commit that basically undoes the reverted commit. A reset however, undoes changes by changing the commit history.</p>
            <p>An analogy would be as such:</p>
            <p>Imagine you were writing an essay and for every revision you would have a new copy (i.e. essay1.docx, essay2.docx, essay3.docx, essay4.docx). You mistakenly deleted your entire intro paragraph in essay3.docx and need to fix it. A revert would be to undo the deletion and save it as essay5.docx while a reset would be to delete everything from essay3.docx onwards and start from essay2.docx.</p>
            <p>If you have the time to spare, I highly recommend <a href="https://learngitbranching.js.org/">this</a> git tutorial. It gives really simple and elegant real-time visualisations of git branches as you perform commands, so you get a rough idea of whats happening to the commit history instead of it feeling like you're just playing with magical commands.</p>
            <p>If anyone else has any tips regarding reverting/resetting please feel free to add on to the discussion

            <p>Association roles are used to indicate the <strong>role played by the classes</strong> in the association. For example, in an association between classes A and B, class A could play the role of the husband and class B plays the role of the wife.</p>
            <p>Association labels are the ones shown in the diagram you linked. They <strong>describe the meaning of the association</strong>. An easy way to distinguish between them is the black arrow present in association labels. Also, it often describes a relationship whereas association roles tend to be nouns like 'friend' or 'helper'!</p>
            <p>This diagram is false because an association label is shown in the diagram, not an association role. I can't remember exactly but I think the question was asking if this was a valid association role! Otherwise, it is a perfectly valid association label.

            <p>What I did was that I changed from <code>Label</code> to the shape <code>Text</code> in both my <code>MainWindow.java</code> and <code>DialogBox.fxml</code> (changed in <code>DialogBox.fxml</code> using Scene Builder). I had read up a bit on online forums and it seems that <code>Label</code> does not adjust based on the size of your text (in this case, the tasks that Duke prints), so there was a recommendation to use <code>Text</code> shape instead. Let me know if this works!

              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>If the delay is from the switch command, you might want to trace your code from the switch.</p>
            <p>If this happens when you start the app, this might mean that certain code is taking too long to run.

            <p>I wouldn't think it's an error with any of my java files in the project. Like I mentioned, the only thing that I did was creating a JAR file. I did no modifications whatsoever to the java files so I wouldn't think that the error lies there. Plus, when I sent the same JAR file to a friend of mine, he was able to run it without any problems.</p>
            <p>More specifically, I'm particularly concerned about these lines right here:</p>
            <pre><code class="hljs">
* What went wrong:

Execution failed for task ':run'.

&gt; Process 'command 'C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-12.0.2\bin\java.exe'' finished with non-zero exit value 1

</code></pre>
            <p>I could be wrong here but it seems something related to the jdk is wrong instead, and I don't know what it is.

            <p>Hmm... I understand what you mean, Prof. My main intention in using call-backs at all was to avoid cylic dependency and high coupling between <code>AppManager</code> and <code>Timer</code>.</p>
            <p>Initially, my idea was to describe the structural relationship this way:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p><code>AppManager</code> is aware of <code>Timer</code>.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><code>Timer</code> however is not directly aware of <code>AppManager</code> (<code>Timer</code> is only aware of a method of <code>AppManager</code>).</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>However, I realise if I were to draw this out as a Class Diagram, I would have</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>A solid arrow from <code>AppManager</code> to <code>Timer</code></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>A dotted-arrow (?) from <code>Timer</code> to <code>AppManager</code> as <code>Timer</code> is &quot;dependent&quot; on <code>AppManager</code>'s method.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>This depiction would suggest a cyclic dependency between <code>AppManager</code> and <code>Timer</code> ... which is what I am attempting to avoid.

            <p>All the suggestions here have been great so far. Admittedly, my original examples were a little contrived for the sake of the discussion (if anyone was wondering, no, I definitely did not use an invalidTaskId custom exception).</p>
            <p>To sum up for any future readers, the general consensus seems to be that we first re-use any exceptions that's already defined in the Standard Java SDK (I would think that this applies even to third-party SDKs if there's a heavy reliance on them in the project), and if that is not sufficient for describing the exception, we extend our own from wherever is applicable/most-related. The aim is to make the Exceptions as understandable as possible to future programmers, and one clearest way of doing it is to use Exceptions that are already standardised among all programmers in the standard SDK.</p>
            <p>My personal take on this issue so far has been to define a custom DukeException class with an overloaded constructor that takes in both an exceptionMessage as well as a Throwable cause (essentially, the original exception that caused it eg. IndexOutOfBoundsException). The DukeException wrapper around the the original exception makes it neater to deal with the way Duke handles most exceptions (by throwing the message to the user in some user-readable form eg. &quot;You need to provide me with a task ID!&quot; when no task ID is given). Chaining the exception with a DukeException also makes it clear that I as the programmer expected this specific error to occur and have attempted to handle it for the specific usage (instead of having a random IndexOutOfBoundsException occur, which is very clear in what was violated but not so much as to what it means for the specific functioning of the program ie. the cause-effect relationship). It's kind of a compromise, so to speak.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, in the rare cases when I need more specific information to handle the exception at a lower-level (which is unlikely at this stage, but you never know in the future), I can simply retrieve the root cause of the DukeException by calling getCause() on the DukeException or by performing a detailed stackTrace print.</p>
            <p>Hope this is helpful. Since it's well into week 6, and this being a week 3 issue with satisfactory answers, I'll be closing the issue here. Do feel free to re-open this if you feel there are more points that merit discussion! Thanks to everyone who took their time to reply.

            <p>The fixes mainly involve integrating the Remark class with the rest of addressbook. I've also put my changes in a <a href="https://github.com/KendrickAng/main/commit/9b7159bc66317fb7a83e9fbe76bba82b15c8c0a5">commit</a>, which follows immediately from the end of the tutorial.</p>
            <p>Here's my (very incomplete) notes trying to figure out what went wrong:</p>
            <p><strong>1. execute_storageThrowsIoException_throwsCommandException</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>AddCommandParser should be able to parse remarks from the argMultiMap. If this was the first test case failure you looked at, AddCommandParser#parse still returns a new Remark(&quot;&quot;) as stated in the tutorial, which is incorrect.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>2. parse_optionalFieldsMissing_success()</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>AddCommandParser needs to support remark parsing (like the above).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>3. parse_allFieldsPresent_success()</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Update PersonBuilder and AddCommandParserTest#asserParseSuccess's <em>userInput</em> fields.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>4. toModelType_typicalPersonsFile_success()</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>JsonAdaptedPerson.java detects that your remarks are null (because we haven't added them).</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>update typicalPersonsAddressBook.json to include the &quot;remark&quot; json object field.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>There's also no remark in TypicalPersons.java (which should match typicalPersonAddressBook.java), so this cases the default remark in PersonBuilder to be used instead, giving us incorrect output.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>5. toModelType_duplicatePersons...</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>duplicatePersonAddressBook.json is missing a remark field. Add <strong>the same</strong> remark for both json objects in the file.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>-&gt; Fixing some of these errors caused others to spring up:</p>
            <p><strong>6. execute_allFieldsSpecifiedUnfiltered</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>The EditCommand needs to allow editing remarks too.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Update: EditCommand.java, EditPersonDescriptor.java, EditPersonDescriptorBuilder.java</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>6.1 This causes the parseCommand_edit... test case to fail.</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>update EditCommandTest#getEditPersonDescriptorDetails to include remarks.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Hope this helps!

            <p>We can make use of the debugger in Intellij to 'Step in' the failing tests.</p>
            <p>After stepping through a few levels, we will realise that most of the failing tests are due to the fact in the file <code>CommandTestUtil.java</code>, we are missing:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p><code>public static final String VALID_REMARK_AMY = &quot;valid remark amy&quot;</code></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><code>public static final String VALID_REMARK_BOB = &quot;valid remark bob&quot;</code></p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>(These are as per the other fields required in building a <code>Person</code> object).</p>
            <p>Adding these two final Strings and using them in the tests will allow most tests to pass as expected.</p>
            <p>We also need to take note that these stub remarks will need to be consistent with the ones in the <code>TypicalPersonsAddressBook.json</code> for the test to pass since the test will compare between the constructed person and the person stored in the .json file.

            <p>Hmm... seems like removing <code>package duke;</code> from Duke.java fixes this issue. Is this expected? Should Duke.java not be in the package? Furthermore, should the <code>mainClassName</code> in build.gradle be set to &quot;Duke&quot; or &quot;duke.Duke&quot;? Thanks!

            <p>Hi @nattanyz , I faced a similar issue as yours when I packaged my app.</p>
            <p>Basically, there are two things you can do:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>Under Edit Configurations...(option is beside the hammer on the top right) &gt; Application &gt; Duke, change the &quot;Use classpath of module:&quot; to duke.main instead of main</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Under File &gt; Project Structure... &gt; Modules, remove the main and test modules (as this should already be under 'duke &gt; main' &amp; 'duke &gt; test')</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>You shouldn't need to remove the <code>package duke;</code> from your Duke.java file and the mainClassName on Gradle should be left as <code>duke.Duke</code>. Hope this helps.

            <p>Just to add on, you will need <code>git add</code> the files that you have fixed before running the above command again. Otherwise, you may see the same error thrown despite having fixed the problem. The reason is that <code>run-checks.sh</code> will call <code>git grep --cached</code> which searches in the staging area.

            <p>@tuandingwei the cause of the error wasn't the test cases. I believe it was from either ASCIIDoctor or Coveralls as there is some dependency within the CI there. We tried commenting out asciidoctor or coveralls but both resulted in further errors because asciidoctor relies on coveralls do generate a html file that is required. we've gotten it to pass temporarily by commenting out our deploy segment within our gradle file but that affects our publication

            <p>I have realised I have to install Gradle on Intellij on the starting page under config. Installing Gradle solved the problem.

            <blockquote>
              <p>I understand files in my jar file is accessed via <code>getResource</code>. So how should i access files outside of my jar in this case?</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Maybe try doing it the same way as storage? Storage creates a <code>data</code> folder in the same directory as the jar file.

            <p>My terminal was running on JDK 1.8 Prof when I compiled the program some time ago. But for creating the shadowJar, I had to update it to JDK 11. I think the error occurred due to the difference in JDK versions for compilation and creation of Jar. So I just compiled the program again (JDK 11). It is working now but I am not very sure if that was the problem. 😕
